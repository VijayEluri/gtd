Git ToDo - Freemind README
--------------------------

Git ToDo is a project that allows setting up and maintain ToDo lists
with a Git-based backend, to allow sharing between machines, and
automatic backup via Git clones.

"Git ToDo - Freemind" integrates GitToDo with Freemind, to allow
graphical visualization of the projects one is working on. Projects
with open TODAY or URGENT items are marked with a 'warning' icon.
Organization of projects is done in Freemind, and preserved between
synchronization with the Git ToDo repository. New projects get added
to the root 'All' node in the Freemind mind map.

Installation
------------

$ cp ant.properties.template ant.properties
$ nano ant.properties

Set the $prefix and the location of the Apache CLI 1.0 jar in ant.properties,
and make sure the $prefix directory is writable.

$ ant clean make install

Next, set up a new Git repository to hold your ToDo items:

$ cd $HOME/var
$ mkdir gtdrepos
$ cd gtdrepos
$ git init
$ git add .

And let Git ToDo know where to find it, by creating a file
$HOME/.gtdrc which should look like:

$ cat ~/.gtdrc
Repository=/home/egonw/var/gtdrepos

Usage
-----

Basic usage:

$ gtd-freemind-update
$ gtd-freemind-show
