Git ToDo README
---------------

Git ToDo is a project that allows setting up and maintain ToDo lists
with a Git-based backend, to allow sharing between machines, and
automatic backup via Git clones.

There currently are two clients, a command line client wrapped around
the core libraries, and a RCP-based client which is not so fancy but
does work. They are available from the subfolders:

com.github.gittodo
com.github.gittodo.rcp
com.github.gittodo.freemind
